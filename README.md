# Student Engagement Analysis
## Project Objective
 This project aims to analyze students' engagement using a platform with paid and free subscription plans. The analysis compares student activity from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022, examining how their viewing habits 
 changed over time, and how engagement differs between paid and free plan users. We aim to identify trends and insights that can inform platform improvements and strategies to boost user engagement.

## Process
- ### Data Collection:
  The data used in this project comes from the 365 Data Science website, tracking how many minutes students spent watching content in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. It helps analyze changes in student engagement over time, 
  comparing paid and free-plan users.

- ### Descriptive Statistics:
  We calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation for both paid and free plan students. This helped me understand overall trends in student engagement and how spread out the engagement levels were.

- ### Skewness & Kurtosis:
  Skewness was used to analyze the asymmetry in the data, showing that engagement was not uniformly distributed. Kurtosis helped identify the presence of outliers or extreme values in student activity.

- ### Confidence Intervals:
  Confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the range of average engagement for both groups and to assess whether there were significant changes in student behavior between 2021 and 2022.

- ### Hypothesis Testing:
  We performed statistical tests (t-tests) to validate if the observed changes in engagement were statistically significant, helping to confirm the conclusions drawn from descriptive statistics.

- ### Regional Analysis:
  We analyzed engagement differences between students in the US and India to understand regional trends and patterns.

## Project Insights
- ### Paid-Plan Students:
  Engagement surged from Q4 2021 (33.80 mins) to Q4 2022 (273.02 mins). Indian students showed higher engagement than U.S. students, with both groups demonstrating significant growth, confirmed by Confidence 
  Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. The data also revealed more variability in 2022, indicating a broader range of engagement levels.

- ### Free-Plan Students:
  The average viewing time increased, but the median decreased, signaling mixed results. U.S. free-plan students showed a smaller increase compared to Indian students. Both groups had a decline in overall 
  engagement in 2022, as confirmed by Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing, indicating a need for improved engagement strategies.

- ### Skewness & Kurtosis:
  Both groups exhibited positive skew, with a few students watching a lot of content. Indian students had more extreme cases of high engagement. The kurtosis values increased, showing a rise in outliers, 
  especially among Indian students in 2022, suggesting a highly engaged subset.

## Final Conclusion
 The analysis shows that paid-plan students significantly increased their engagement over the one year, while free-plan students showed mixed results, with a decrease in typical engagement. The findings suggest 
 that the paid-plan model leads to higher engagement, but there is a need for targeted strategies to boost the engagement of free-plan users. Additionally, regional differences, especially between students in the 
 US and India, highlight potential areas for growth and content customization.

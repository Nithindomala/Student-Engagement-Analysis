# 365DataScience Student Engagement Data: An Excel Analysis
## Project Objective
  This project aims to analyze students' engagement using a platform with paid and free subscription plans. The analysis compares student activity from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022, examining how their viewing habits 
  changed over time, and how engagement differs between paid and free plan users. We aim to identify trends and insights that can inform platform improvements and strategies to boost user engagement.

## Process
- ### Data Collection:
  The data used in this project comes from the 365 Data Science website, tracking how many minutes students spent watching content in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. It helps 
 analyze changes in student engagement over time, comparing paid and free-plan users.[Raw Data File Link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qtvfrk8vn0hl0edex08aj/Engagement-Project.xlsx?rlkey=qnnjeb21t4l5687rqxjir0bte&st=yhi9yzh9&dl=0)

- ### Descriptive Statistics:
  Analyzed engagement data for both paid and free-plan students using key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation. By exploring skewness and kurtosis, we uncovered important patternsâ€”revealing asymmetries in engagement and identifying outliers, which highlighted extreme behaviors.[Excel Analysis File](https://github.com/Nithindomala/Student-Engagement-Analysis/blob/main/Descriptive%20Statistics%20-%20tasks%201-2.xlsx)
  
- ### Confidence Intervals: 
  Calculated confidence intervals to confidently estimate the range of student engagement across both years, enabling a clear view of how student behavior shifted between 2021 and 2022. This provided a solid foundation for further analysis.[Excel Analysis File](https://github.com/Nithindomala/Student-Engagement-Analysis/blob/main/Confidence%20Intervals%20-%20task%203.xlsx)
  
- ### Hypothesis Testing:
  Conducted t-tests to validate whether engagement changes were statistically significant, ensuring the results were reliable. The test outcomes are available in the [Excel Analysis File]().

- ### Regional Analysis:
  Regional analysis (comparing US vs. India students) revealed key regional trends, helping to tailor engagement strategies based on geographic patterns.The regional analysis results are available in the [Excel Analysis File]() .


  
## Project Insights
- ### Paid-Plan Students:
  Engagement surged from Q4 2021 (33.80 mins) to Q4 2022 (273.02 mins). Indian students showed higher engagement than U.S. students, with both groups demonstrating significant growth, confirmed by Confidence 
  Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. The data also revealed more variability in 2022, indicating a broader range of engagement levels.

- ### Free-Plan Students:
  The average viewing time increased, but the median decreased, signaling mixed results. U.S. free-plan students showed a smaller increase compared to Indian students. Both groups had a decline in overall 
  engagement in 2022, as confirmed by Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing, indicating a need for improved engagement strategies.

- ### Skewness & Kurtosis:
  Both groups exhibited positive skew, with a few students watching a lot of content. Indian students had more extreme cases of high engagement. The kurtosis values increased, showing a rise in outliers, 
  especially among Indian students in 2022, suggesting a highly engaged subset.

## Final Conclusion
  The analysis shows that paid-plan students significantly increased their engagement over the one year, while free-plan students showed mixed results, with a decrease in typical engagement. The findings suggest 
  that the paid-plan model leads to higher engagement, but there is a need for targeted strategies to boost the engagement of free-plan users. Additionally, regional differences, especially between students in 
  the US and India, highlight potential areas for growth and content customization.
